"Hi Anil,

Following our conversation, I validated the new fields added for prop_tax_due, term_process_day_key, hld_dt_ind, and bkrpt_status_cd using the Jan 31st portfolio (portfolio day_key is 20240131) by comparing them with SAS DW. I found some mismatches:

- There are 90 accounts in Databricks with values for prop_tax_due, but in SAS DW, it shows NULL.
- There are 2510 accounts in Databricks missing values for term_process_day_key, hld_dt_ind, and bkrpt_status_cd, but in SAS DW, they have values.

I have attached the details by field. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,"
