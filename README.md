Dear Aimee,

I hope this message finds you well.

I recently became aware that the Department of Labor (DOL) has introduced a feature to search for PERM status. Could you please provide me with my case number for the PERM application? I'd like to utilize this new feature to check on my application's status.

Thank you in advance for your assistance!

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
