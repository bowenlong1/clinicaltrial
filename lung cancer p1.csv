The study tests the combination of two medicines called BI 754111 and BI 754091 that may help the immune system to fight the cancer. Such medicines are called immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The study has two parts. In the first part, doctors want to find out the highest dose of 2 medicines that people with solid tumors can tolerate. This dose is then used for the second part of the study.

In the second part, the combination of the two medicines is tested in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and other types of solid cancer. These patients had gotten treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 medicines but their tumors have come back. The doctors check whether the combination of BI 754111 and BI 754091 makes tumors shrink.

* Malignant mesothelioma is a form of cancer that develops on the protective lining that covers the body's internal organs. It most often occurs on the lining of the lungs and chest wall or the lining of the abdomen. There is no known cure for malignant mesothelioma, so researchers are searching for new ways to treat it.
* Mesothelin is a protein that is found in mesothelioma and other types of cancer cells. An experimental cancer drug called SS1P is designed to attack cells that have mesothelin while leaving healthy cells alone. Researchers want to test how effective SS1P is when it is given with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide. These drugs help suppress the immune system and may make the SS1P more effective.

Objectives:

- To study the effectiveness of SS1P plus two drugs that suppress the immune system to treat malignant mesothelioma.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have malignant mesothelioma in the chest or abdomen.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests. They will also have imaging studies.
* The first treatment cycle will last 30 days. Up to three 21-day cycles of treatment will follow.
* In the first cycle, participants will have pentostatin on days 1, 5, and 9. They will have cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 12. They will have SS1P on days 10, 12, and 14.
* On the next three cycles, participants will have pentostatin on day 1.They will have cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 4. They will have SS1P on days 2, 4, and 6.
* Participants will have frequent blood tests and other studies. They will receive all four cycles of treatment as long as there are no severe side effects.

During the accelerated titration phase, patients were enrolled in a cohort of 1 new patient for each dose level and treated for 4 weeks at that level. Any DLT or instance of MT during any 4 week treatment at any dose level led to the initiation of standard titration (3+3) phase.

If none of the first 3 patients experienced any DLT, then dose escalation proceeded for the next cohort of patients. If 1 of 3 patients developed DLT, the cohort was expanded to at most 6 patients (another 3 patients added subsequently). If exactly 1 of the 6 patients experienced DLT, then escalation to the next dose level occurred.

ETBX-011, ETBX-061, and ETBX-051 are cancer vaccines. Their goal is to teach the immune system to target and kill cancer cells. The vaccines target 3 proteins found in many types of cancer. Researchers think targeting all 3 proteins in unison will have the best results.

Objective:

To test the safety of combining ETBX-011, ETBX-061, and ETBX-051 and their effects on the immune system.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older with advanced cancer that has not responded to standard therapies

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history

Physical exam

Blood, urine, and heart tests

Scan: They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

Participants will receive the 3 vaccines through 3 shots under the skin every 3 weeks for 3 doses, then every 8 weeks for up to 1 year. They will have blood and urine tests at each vaccine visit. They will have scans and other measurements of their tumor after 9 weeks and then at their vaccine visits every 8 weeks.

Participants will keep a diary of symptoms at the injection site.

Participants will have a visit 90 days after their final treatment. This will include a physical exam and blood and urine tests. If they have any ongoing side effects, they will be followed until these end or are not changing.

After this visit, they will be called every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for the next 2 years, then every 12 months for another 2 years to see how they are doing.

Participants will have the option to enroll in a long-term follow-up study.

Cetuximab targets a receptor on cancer cells called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor or EGFR. It is thought that this receptor is turned ""on"" in some cancers, enabling cancer cells to divide and grow. Blocking this receptor can turn this signal off. Cetuximab blocks this receptor from the outside of cancer cells. It is thought that cancer cells can turn this signal back on by the EGFR joining with a related receptor called ErbB2. Lapatinib blocks both EGFR and ErbB2 from the inside of cancer cells. In laboratory experiments it has been found that combining drugs that target both EGFR and ErbB2 might work better in turning this signal back off. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dosages that patients can tolerate when these two medicines are given at the same time.

In addition, in order to be on this trial, patients must agree to have a tumor biopsy before starting treatment on this study and 21 days after starting treatment.

This study is meant to study how tolerable and effective it would be to increase the intensity of chest radiation for small cell lung cancer patients by increasing the daily radiation dose. We aim to find the highest dose of chest radiotherapy that can be safely given with chemotherapy using this strategy. Patients in this trial will be monitored before, during and after their radiation and chemotherapy treatments for treatment side-effects, how effective treatments are at controlling their cancer and quality of life changes. Results from this trial will help to define more effective radiotherapy doses which are tolerable for this type of lung cancer and the quality of life changes patients experience when they undergo these treatments.",NO,Lung Neoplasm|Small Cell Carcinoma,PROCEDURE: hypofractionated external beam,Rates of acute grade 3 or higher radiotherapy toxicities,"Overall survival and disease free survival, patient related quality of life",,AHS Cancer Control Alberta,Cross Cancer Institute,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,24,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,LU-11-0072 / 23117,2007-03,2011-04,2011-04,2007-05-04,,2016-02-25,"Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada",

NCT02555007,Metronomic Chemotherapy Based on Adaptative Bio-mathematical Model of Oral Vinorelbine in Patients With NSCLC or MPM,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02555007,NVB Metro,COMPLETED,"Background: Metronomic oral Vinorelbine has efficacy in metastatic NSCLC and malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, but all the studies published thus far were based upon a variety of empirical and possibly suboptimal schedules, with inconsistent results. Mathematical modeling showed by simulation that a new metronomic protocol could lead to a better safety and efficacy profile.

Design: This phase Ia/Ib trial was designed to confirm safety (phase Ia) and evaluate efficacy (phase Ib) of a new metronomic oral vinorelbine schedule. Patient with metastatic NSCLC or malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, after failure of standard treatments, ECOG 0-2 and an adequate organ functions, will be eligible. Our mathematical PK-PD model suggested an alternative weekly D1, D2 and D4 innovative schedule (named Vinorelbine Theoretical Protocol) with a dynamic intake of 60, 30 and 60 mg, respectively. Trial recruitment is two-staged as 12 patients are planned to participate in the phase Ia, to confirm safety and consolidate the calibration of the average parameters of the model. Depending the phase Ia result, and after favorable decision of a consultative committee, the extension phase (phase Ib) will be an efficacy study and will include a number of 20 patients receiving the Optimal Vinorelbine Theoretical Protocol. The primary endpoint is the tolerance (assessed by CTC v4.0) for the phase Ia and the objective response according to RECIST 1.1 for the phase Ib.

An ancillary study on circulating angiogenesis biomarkers will be a subproject of the trial.

Discussion: this ongoing trial is the first to prospectively test a mathematical optimized schedule in metronomic chemotherapy.

NCT02334007,Extended Low-Molecular Weight Heparin VTE Prophylaxis in Thoracic Surgery,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02334007,,COMPLETED,"After any surgery, there is a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the major veins of the legs and Pulmonary Embolus (PE) in the lungs. These clots are usually prevented by the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin, a blood thinner that prevents clotting. In most surgical specialties like thoracic or vascular surgery, this treatment is used until patients are discharged from the hospital. However, in orthopaedic surgery, there is strong evidence that longer term preventative treatment up to 35 days after hospital discharge helps to reduce VTE occurrences. In thoracic surgery, there is an even greater risk of developing PE because of the surgical stress, the common presence of cancer and direct damage to blood vessels in the lung during surgery. Despite the potential utility, the use of extended VTE prevention has never been evaluated in the thoracic surgery population. If extended treatment prevents clots, more patients will avoid complications related to VTE. There is currently very limited information available on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and the utility of extended thromboprophylaxis (ET) in this patient population. Furthermore, in contrast to patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery where ET has become standard of care, duration of thromboprophylaxis is not well defined in this patient population.

As a result, treating the tumor with radiation has become the main standard of treatment. Radiation therapy though, is limited by various factors, including the difficulty in properly imaging the lung tumor since the lung can move up to 4 cm between breathing in and out. Consequently, a radiation oncologist must consider a larger area of the lung to treat with radiation - increasing the amount of normal tissue exposed to harmful rays and therefore leading to increased side-effects. Two techniques being explored into improving tumor management while minimizing the side effects in NSCLC are breath-held gating and tomotherapy. Breath-held gating is a technique for consistently imaging the tumor at the right moment in a patient's breathing cycle - decreasing the normal tissue exposed to harmful radiation. Tomotherapy, a new technique in delivering radiation, will further allow the investigators to focus treatment on the tumor and exclude more normal tissues. Therefore, they hope that these methods will prove to be a better way in treating people with NSCLC.",NO,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",PROCEDURE: Tomotherapy,safety and adverse events,efficacy and survival,,AHS Cancer Control Alberta,Cross Cancer Institute,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,LU-11-0051 / 21808,2005-04,2006-09,2006-09,2005-08-11,,2016-02-25,"Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1Z2, Canada",

* Dimethane sulfonate (DMS612) is an investigational drug that is being administered to humans for the first time in people with advanced tumors. More information on the maximum tolerated dose of DMS612 will help researchers identify whether the drug is suitable for use in treating certain kinds of cancer, particularly renal cell carcinoma.

Objectives:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose of DMS612 (the highest dose that does not cause unacceptable side effects) and evaluate any side effects.
* To see if DMS612 has any effect on patients tumors through blood tests and laboratory studies.
* To learn how the body processes DMS612.

Eligibility:

* Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with cancer that has not responded well to standard treatments.

Design:

* Pre-treatment evaluation visit to determine eligibility:
* Physical examination
* Blood and urine tests
* Chest X-ray; electrocardiogram; CAT scan of chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of the body if needed
* Other possible tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET)
* Patients will receive one dose of DMS612 by intravenous infusion once a week for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week without the drug. Doses will be adjusted based on possible side effects and cancer response. The disease will be evaluated after three cycles of the drug.
* Evaluations during the treatment period:
* Physical examination and reviews of side effects.
* Blood draws to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug, and how it is processed by the body.
* CAT scan at the end of every two cycles (every 8 weeks).
* Other scans and imaging procedures as required by the study doctors.",NO,Renal Cell Carcinoma|Breast Cancer|Colon Cancer|Lung Cancer|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,DRUG: DMS 612,"Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose, Number of DLTs in on a given dose level., End of Cycle 1","Evaluate non-dose limiting toxicity, Number of overall toxicities on the study., Treatment Completion|PK, Drug level in blood, Collection of Samples|Anti-tumor Effects, Proportion of patients whose tumors shrunk after therapy, Disease Progression",,National Cancer Institute (NCI),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,60,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,090111|09-C-0111,2009-03-25,2016-05-12,2018-12-03,2009-06-18,,2018-12-05,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States|Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania, 17033, United States|University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15261, United States",
NCT01778920,Pilot and Feasibility Study of the Imaging Potential of EC17: Intraoperative Folate-fluorescein Conjugate (EC17) Lung Cancer (CA),https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01778920,,COMPLETED,"The goal of this study is to perform imaging of patient's tumors while the chest is open and the tumor is being removed.

According to the World Health Organization, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women, and is responsible for 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually as of 2004. Surgery remains the best option for patients presenting with operable Stage I or II cancers, however the five year survival rate for these candidates remains at a dismal 53% for Stage I and 32% for Stage II. The high rates of recurrence suggest that surgeons are unable to completely detect and remove primary tumor nodules in a satisfactory manner as well as lingering metastases in sentinel lymph nodes. By ensuring a negative margin through imaging during surgery it would be possible for us to improve the rates of recurrence free patients and thus overall survival.

Thoracic malignancies are the ideal disease to investigate intra-operative imaging. Over 85% of lung and pleural malignancies express folate receptor alpha (FRA). It is important to note that FRA is expressed only in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, activated macrophages, and in the choroidal plexus. Thus, the false positive detection rate is expected to be extremely low. A group well known to us in the Netherlands has completed a pilot study utilizing a folate-fluorescein isothiocyanate (folate-FITC) conjugate in 12 patients with ovarian cancer. Another group of investigators in Mayo have subsequently performed this study on 20 more patients without any serious adverse events (personal communication). They report excellent sensitivity and specificity with this technique with only grade 1 side effects (allergic reaction). All side effects reversed when the injection was halted.

The extent of product bioavailability is estimated by the area under the blood concentration vs time curve. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is calculated by plotting the drug's blood levels on a graph at different times during the set period. The area under this curve reflects the amount of drug exposure in the set time period, calculated as hour \* nanograms (ng) per milliliter (mL), which equates to mg.day/L. Bioavailability Extrapolated to Infinity \[AUC (0-inf)\] is a calculated measure of how much of the drug will ever reach the person's bloodstream for the body to use. AUC (0-inf) stands for the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (forever). It is obtained from calculating AUC (0-t) plus AUC (t-inf)., on day 1 of cycle 2, 1 hour pre-dose and 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 168, 336 and 504 hours after the start of the infusion|Clearance (CL) for Pertuzumab (Cycle 2) in the Presence of Erlotinib (at Steady-state) in Patients With NSCLC, A fundamental concept in pharmacokinetics is drug clearance (CL), that is, elimination of drugs from the body. The clearance is simply the ratio of the dose to the area under the curve (AUC), so that the higher the AUC for a given dose, the lower the clearance. If a drug is administered by continuous infusion and a steady state is achieved, the clearance can be estimated from a single measurement of the plasma drug concentration., on day 1 of cycle 2, 1 hour pre-dose and 0.5, 1.5, 4, 8, 24, 168, 336 and 504 hours after the start of the infusion|Volume of Distribution at Steady-state (Vss) for Pertuzumab (Cycle 2) in the Presence of Erlotinib (at Steady-state) in Patients With NSCLC, Steady-state volume of distribution of a drug is an estimate of drug distribution independent of elimination processes. It is most useful for predicting the plasma concentrations following multiple dosing to a steady-state or pseudo-equilibrium. Vss is proportional to the amount of drug in the body versus the plasma concentration of the drug at steady state (pseudo-equilibrium).

Currently used chemotherapy regimens have been disappointing in improving overall survival. Decitabine is a S-phase pyrimidine analog that induces DNA hypomethylation. This drug is currently used to treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS) and has been studied for the treatment of leukemia. Genistein, is a soy extracted non-toxic isoflavone and phytoestrogen, which has been shown to inhibit activity of cell signaling pathways, such as those driven by tyrosine kinases. Results from in vitro experiments unambiguously demonstrated that the combination of these two compounds induces a synergistic reduction of the multiplication of lung, colon, breast and leukemic cancer cells. Consequently, clinical evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC), and it is hypothezised that this new regimen will safely improve overall tumor response rate and cancer progression free survival.

The proposed trial is a two part study: The phase I part is an open-label, dose-escalation evaluation in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have failed standard therapies and for whom no curative therapeutic option exists.

A cohort of three subjects will be treated per dose level. One cycle is 28 days. Five different, increasing dose levels ranging from 60 mg/m2 to 500 mg/m2 of IV decitabine combined with a fixed oral dose of 150 mg BID of genistein will be tested. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined based on the occurrence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).

In the phase IIa part of the study, only Stage IIIb and IV advanced NSCLC patients will be treated at the recommended decitabine MTD dose combined with genistein.

A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic (excluding nausea, vomiting, and alopecia) and grade 4 hematologic toxicities. Six patients were to be accrued at each dose level. If no more than three of the six patients experienced a DLT then that dose level was considered acceptable and dose escalation occurred by accruing six more patients at the next dose level. Otherwise, the preceding dose level, if any, would be declared the MTD. The MTD would be used for the Phase II arm. At a given dose, the probability of halting dose escalation when the true toxicity is 50% or higher is at least 66% (power). In addition, if the true DLT rate is instead 20%, there will still be a 10% probability of halting dose escalation at a given dose level (type I error).

At present, the commonly used drugs for intrathecal chemotherapy include methotrexate, cytarabine, and liposomal cytarabine. In recent decades, no new effective drugs have been discovered for intrathecal chemotherapy. The recurrence of leptomeningeal metastases is inevitable even after aggressive treatment. There is no effective treatment for recurrent leptomeningeal metastases after comprehensive treatment which includes intrathecal methotrexate and/or cytarabine, central nervous system radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy as well as tyrosine-kinase inhibitor drugs. The quality of life is extremely poor, and the patients always die in short time. Pemetrexed is a newer multitargeted antifolate which has shown activity in various tumors. It has higher effectiveness and safety, which has been used as the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. In animal studies, pemetrexed was demonstrated to suppress tumor growth completely in mice with two types of transplanted human colon xenografts resistant to methotrexate.

Lutathera is an investigational radioactive agent that targets tumor cells that express SSRT. Nivolumab is an investigational agent that targets and inhibits a pathway that prevents your immune system from effectively fighting your cancer. The combination of these 2 study drugs is investigational. The term ""Investigational"" in this context means that the drugs have not been approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Giving Lutathera and nivolumab together may increase the effectiveness of this therapy. We first need to find out the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given safely together with nivolumab. This study will be the first study to test giving Lutathera together with nivolumab. Once we have found the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given with nivolumab, we will treat more patients with this combination to determine how effective it is.

NCT00037817,Phase I Study of Gene Induction Mediated by Sequential Decitabine/Depsipeptide Infusion With or Without Concurrent Celecoxib in Subjects With Pulmonary and Pleural Malignancies,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00037817,,COMPLETED,"Background:

Previously we have demonstrated induction of tumor antigen and tumor suppressor gene expression in lung cancer cells following exposure to the DNA demethylating agent, Decitabine (DAC). We have also demonstrated that DAC mediated target gene expression and apoptosis can be significantly enhanced in cancer cells by subsequent exposure to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Depsipeptide FK228 (DP). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that following DAC, or DAC/DP exposure, cancer cells can be recognized by cytolytic T cells specific for the cancer testis antigen, NY-FSO-1.

This Phase I study will evaluate gene induction in thoracic oncology patients mediated by sequential DAC/DP treatment with or without the selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib.

Objectives:

Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of continuous 72-hour intravenous Decitabine (DAC) infusion followed by 4-hour intravenous infusion of Depsipeptide FK228 (DP) with or without oral celecoxib in patients with unresectable cancers involving the lungs or pleura.

Analysis of NY-ESO-1, p16 and p21 expression in cancer specimens before and after sequential Decitabine/Depsipeptide treatment.

Analysis of serologic response to NY-ESO-1 before and after sequential drug treatment.

Analysis of apoptosis in tumor biopsies before and after sequential Decitabine/Depsipeptide treatment.

Refinement of laser capture microdissection and micro-array techniques for analysis of gene expression profiles in tumor tissues.

Eligibility:

Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary small cell or non-small cell lung cancers, advanced esophageal cancers, pleural mesotheliomas, or non-thoracic cancers with metastases to the lungs or pleura.

Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and have adequate pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO greater than the 30% predicted, and less than 50 mm Hg and p02 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG.

Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100.000. an ANC equal to or greater than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of less than 1.5 x upper limits of normal. Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater than 70 ml/min/1.73m(2).

Design:

Patients with inoperable malignancies involving lungs or pleura will receive two cycles of 72-hour intravenous infusion of Decitabine followed by 4-hour Depsipeptide infusion using a Phase I study design.

Decitabine will be administered by continuous infusion on days 1-4, and patient cohorts will receive escalating doses of Depsipeptide administered on day 4 and day 10 of a 34 day cycle.

Once the MTD and toxicities for sequential DAC/DP have been identified, additional cohorts of 6 lung cancer patients and 6 mesothelioma patients will receive sequential DAC/DP administered at the MTD as outlined above with celecoxib (400mg bid) administered on days 4-34 of each treatment cycle, as a means to enhance target cell apoptosis and facilitate anti-tumor immune recognition/response.

Pharmacokinetics, systemic toxicity, and response to therapy will be recorded. Tumor biopsies will be obtained prior to, and after therapy to evaluate expression of NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, as well as p16 and p21 tumor suppressor genes, which are known to be modulated by chromatin structure. Additional analysis will be undertaken to evaluate the extent of apoptosis in tumor tissues, and to determine if immune recognition of NY-ESO-1 can be demonstrated following sequential DAC?DP +/- celecoxib treatment.

As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined following completion of the trial and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than definitive.

NCT01218854,A Comparison of Methods for Assisting Needle Angle Selection During Image-guided Tissue Biopsy,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01218854,,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Currently, standard procedures for biopsies that are guided by computed tomography (CT) imaging involve CT scans and a computer program to plan and illustrate where the physician will place the needle to obtain the required cells or tissue. Inserting the biopsy needle at the planned angle is not an easy task, because the appropriate angle of insertion must be estimated based on prior experience. Researchers are studying experimental techniques that might provide better guidance about the right angle to insert the biopsy needle and thereby improve the collection of the appropriate biopsy cells or tissue.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the effectiveness of two biopsy needle guidance methods in CT-guided tissue biopsy.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have CT-guided tissue biopsy.

Design:

* Participants will have a tissue biopsy guided by CT scans and either a laser system or a plastic block to illustrate the appropriate angle of insertion. The skin will be numbed with anesthetic to minimize discomfort during the procedure.
* Before inserting the biopsy needle, the study physician will hold the needle in place so that a Food and Drug Administration-approved medical GPS (electromagnetic tracking) system can measure the needle angle as it enters the tissue.
* After the needle angle data has been collected, researchers will proceed with the actual biopsy procedure as it would normally occur, using standard methods.
* No additional treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.",NO,Lung Neoplasms|Liver Neoplasms|Kidney Neoplasms|Cancer,DEVICE: Needle angle measurement,"Difference between L-NASS and standard method, Data is currently undergoing analysis, Completion of study|Differnce between B-NASS and standard method, Data is currently undergoing analysis, Completion of study|The difference between MD-NASS and standard method, Data is currently undergoing analysis, Completion of study",,,National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,17,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,100217|10-CC-0217,2012-03-20,2016-11-16,2016-11-16,2010-10-11,,2023-07-07,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

Several experimental and clinical studies have indicated that FMISO uptake of tissues is correlated with tissue oxygen tension and that FMSO PET allows non-invasive differentiation between hypoxic and normoxic tumors. Currently, FMISO-PET represents the best characterized and validated noninvasive hypoxia imaging technique. Nevertheless, clinical studies have also shown the limitations of FMISO PET. Accumulation of FMISO in hypoxic tumors is relatively low, resulting in a low contrast between hypoxic tumors and surrounding normal tissues. In addition, imaging needs to be started relatively late after tracer injection (about 3 hours post-injection), when a significant percentage of the fluorine-18 label has already decayed and the count statistics of the PET images are relatively low.

In LAM, abnormal, muscle-like cells begin to grow out of control in the lungs. As a result, air can't move freely in and out of the lungs. In some cases, this means the lungs can't supply the body's other organs with enough oxygen.

This study is being conducted to find out what dose of a drug called saracatinib is best tolerated by people with LAM. This drug has been tested in patients with certain types of cancer but is not currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Saracatinib may work in cancer by preventing the growth, movement and invasiveness of cancer cells. The use of saracatinib to treat LAM is considered experimental. Preliminary testing already completed suggests that the study drug, saracatinib, may suppress certain substances in the lungs of patients with LAM thus may be effective in slowing down the disease process",NO,Pulmonary Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,DRUG: Saracatinib,"Dose Determination, One of three escalating daily oral doses of saracatinib; 50, 125 and 175 mg.

* Carboplatin-paclitaxel is a commonly used chemotherapy combination for advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and other solid tumors. In a randomized clinical trial, the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and the additional chemotherapy drug bevacizumab had a better response rate and survival compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone. However, this trial treated only patients with a specific diagnosis and treatment risks. Further research is needed to determine whether this combination is useful for other diagnoses.
* YM155 is a drug that targets a type of chemical often found in cancer cells. It has been investigated in several phase I and phase II clinical trials, and it has been shown to be well tolerated and moderately effective in treating advanced NSCLC in patients who had not responded well to one or two standard treatments.

Objectives:

- To determine the efficacy of the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and YM155 in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.

Eligibility:

- Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma or other solid tumors for which standard therapy is not likely to be effective.

Design:

* Before the start of the study, participants will be screened with a medical history, blood tests, imaging scans of the affected areas, tumor biopsies, and other tests as directed by the study doctors.
* Participants will be treated for six 21-day cycles, or 18 weeks of treatment. Each cycle will include blood tests and imaging studies as required.
* On day 1 of each cycle, participants will receive an infusion of paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by a 4-day infusion of YM155 (through a portable electronic infusion pump).
* Participants will have a computed tomography scan or other imaging every other cycle (approximately every 6 weeks) to determine whether the therapy is affecting the cancer site.
* After the sixth cycle, participants will return for follow-up visits at least every 3 months, and will be asked to remain in contact with the researchers to allow further study of the long-term effects of the treatment.",YES,NSCLC|Solid Tumors,DRUG: YM155|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel,"Phase 1 Safe and Tolerable Phase 2 Dose., Phase I: Doses were given at different dose levels until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached.

In this task, the playing cards are all red or black jokers. The on-screen instructions ask: ""Is the card red?"". A playing card is presented face down in the center of the screen. The card flips over so it is face up. As soon as it flips over the participant must decide whether the card is red or not. If it is red the participant should press ""Yes"", and if it is not red the participant should press ""No"". The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded and mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is calculated. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2-5, Day 1 of every other cycle from Cycle 6, and end of treatment (up to 3 years)|Change From Baseline in Total Scores for One Back Test (Cognitive Function Assessment) (Phase 2), The One Back Test is a measure of working memory and uses a well validated n back paradigm with playing cards. In this task, the on-screen instructions ask: ""Is the previous card the same?"". A playing card is presented in the center of the screen. The participant must decide whether the card is the same as the previous card. If it is the same the participant should press ""Yes"", and if not press ""No"". The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded, mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is used to demonstrate speed of performance, and the arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses is used to demonstrate accuracy. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline.

High frequencies, high imagery, concrete nouns (items from a shopping list) were read to the participant at the rate of one word every 2 seconds. Once all 12 words had been read, the participant was asked to recall as many of the words as quickly as possible. The words recalled by the participant were marked on the computer screen. When the participant could recall no more words, the same list was read again. The words recalled by the participant were recorded. This was then repeated a third time. Total number of correct responses on 3 consecutive trials at a single assessment was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2-5, Day 1 of every other cycle from Cycle 6, and end of treatment (up to 3 years)|Change From Baseline in Total Scores for International Shopping List Test-Delayed Recall (Cognitive Function Assessment) (Phase 2), This test was performed in the same way as the International Shopping List Test, with the exception that, the delayed recall condition required the participant to recall the words from the list 15 30 minutes later without having the list read again. During the recognition condition, the qualified personnel read a shopping list item that may or may not have been on the original list and the participant had to respond either affirmatively (if the item was on the original list) or negatively (if it was not). Total number of correct responses made in remembering the word list after a delay was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2-5, Day 1 of every other cycle from Cycle 6, and end of treatment (up to 3 years)",,Pfizer,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,334,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: |Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,B7461001|2013-002620-17,2014-01-08,2017-03-15,2023-05-24,2013-10-28,2018-03-05,2023-06-07,"Highlands Oncology Group/Research, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72703, United States|Highlands Oncology Group, Rogers, Arkansas, 72758, United States|Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Orange, California, 92868-3201, United States|UC Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California, 92868-3201, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|University of Colorado Hospital, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|MDZ: Yale-New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut, 06504, United States|Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven, New Haven, Connecticut, 06510, United States|Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia, 20007, United States|Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan, 48201, United States|Karmanos Center Institute, Detroit, Michigan, 48201, United States|Karmanos Cancer Institute, Farmington Hills, Michigan, 48334, United States|Siteman Cancer Center-West County, Creve Coeur, Missouri, 63141, United States|Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Siteman Cancer Center-South County, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63129, United States|Rockefeller Patient Pavilion -

NCT00256815,Combination of Weekly Chest Radiotherapy and Oral Navelbine for the Palliation of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Phase I Study,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00256815,,COMPLETED,"The study is designed for subjects whose cancer is too advanced and therefore cannot be operated with the goal of completely removing the cancer. At this stage of the disease, most subjects cannot be cured from the disease, however, treatment can help subjects to live longer and better by keeping the cancer under control. All treatment offered to is primarily pursuing that goal. Subjects at this stage of their disease traditionally receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy, both treatments in succession or both concurrently. Recently, the administration of both methods of treatment concurrently has been employed and indicate somewhat better results. Specifically, a class of chemotherapy agents called Vinca Alakaloids used in combination with radiation therapy appear promising as determined in small studies. The drug Navelbine is part of this class of drugs. This drug is approved as an infusion through the veins. The pill form is under development and will be used in this form in this treatment program.

For this protocol, radiation will be administered using a schedule which is more convenient for patients, by once weekly chest irradiation for a total of 12 weeks. Use of this schedule was determined to be as good as the more commonly used daily radiotherapy. The once weekly schedule is less cumbersome as it involves less visits. The rationale and reason why you are being asked to participate in this program is to study whether the drug Navelbine can be given together with the once weekly radiation schedule. Radiation will be administered in two fractions, 6 hours apart on one day. For this program, the drug Navelbine would be made available as a pill, and would not have to be infused through the vein. The proposed protocol will use increasing doses of the drug Navelbine in pill form to find the highest dose of Navelbine that is tolerated in conjunction with radiation therapy. Initially, each subject will receive one dose of Navelbine, which is higher than the dose of the previous subject. This escalation will continue until the highest tolerated dose has been determined.

The administration via pill would be easier and avoid previously experienced side effects that were experienced by infusion into the veins of subjects, such as burning and sores at the infusion site.",NO,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",DRUG: chemotherapy|PROCEDURE: Radiation,Safety|Toxicity,Efficacy|Survival,,Clinical Oncology Research Associates,GlaxoSmithKline,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,35,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,Hypo 3,2003-03,,2005-09,2005-11-22,,2014-02-11,"LSUHSC, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70112, United States",

Treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) can be given with curative intent to selected patients with locally advanced, stage III disease. Patients with stage III tumours associated with a pleural effusion, and patients who present with advanced, metastatic disease (stage IV) are treated palliatively with no prospect of cure. In the latter, radiotherapy (RT) is offered with the aim of improving symptoms, achieving tumour control and optimising quality of life. It is generally believed that a plateau has been reached for combination of chemotherapy with radiotherapy lung cancer. There is a strong rationale for combining molecular targeted agents with irradiation. AZD6244 is a potent, selective, uncompetitive inhibitor of MEK that has been tested in early phase clinical trials either alone or in combination with chemotherapy in a variety of cancers including lung cancer. Preclinical studies have shown that AZD6244 enhances the effect of radiation. AZD6244 has not yet been combined with radiotherapy in clinical trials. In this study, a maximum of 18 patients will be allocated to one of 3 doses of AZD6244 in combination with a standard dose of RT in a Phase 1 dose escalation/ de-escalation design to determine the recommended dose for Phase 2 trials (RP2D).

NCT04037462,Induction of Sensecence Using Dexamethasone to Re-sensitize NSCLC to Anti-PD1 Therapy,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04037462,,COMPLETED,"Lung cancer accounts for 30% of all cancers among American war Veterans and remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths. Half of all lung cancers are metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a 2-year survival rate of 10%. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy that aims to harness the immune system to fight lung cancer. However, given the modest response rates of 20-25% to these immune checkpoint inhibitors, there is a greater desire to extend their benefits to more patients. Along with the desire to extend their benefits, there is a critical need for the development of novel approaches that can expand the benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and create more durable responses, prolonging survival from lung cancer. The investigators' studies show that extended dexamethasone (Dex) treatment induces irreversible cell cycle blockade and a senescence phenotype through chronic activation of the p27Kip1 gene in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) overexpressing lung adenocarcinoma (AC) cell populations. Further, following withdrawal of Dexamethasone, proteins associated with the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) strongly attracted and expanded T-cells, NK cells and monocytes stimulated tumor cell cytolytic activity of NK cells. Therefore, dexamethasone may induce a persistent senescence phenotype in tumor cell sub-populations expressing moderate/high levels of GR and resultant chemokines produced by the senescent cells will mobilize host immune cells to reboot response to immune checkpoint inhibitors following complete Dexamethasone withdrawal.",NO,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Immunotherapy,DRUG: Dexamthasone,"Reduction in FLT-PET signal, In the first stage, three Dex escalation cohorts will be evaluated sequentially from Cohort A to Cohort C until \> 2 patients exhibit FLT-PET response (i.e., 30% reduction in FLT-PET uptake in at least one target lesion); otherwise, the trial will be terminated due to futility., 12 months","Response rate, The primary objective in SA 2 is to assess the effect of Dex on pembrolizumab in terms of overall response rate (ORR).

* The effectiveness and side effects of NK cell therapy
* How the body handles NK cells.

People between 18 and 70 years of age who have a solid tumor or leukemia, and for whom standard treatments are not effective, may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures:

Apheresis to collect NK cells. For this procedure, a catheter (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the subject s arm. Blood flows from the vein into a cell separator machine, which separates the white cells from the other blood components. The white cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through a second tube placed in a vein in the other arm.

Chemotherapy with the drug pentostatin to suppress the immune system and prevent it from attacking the NK cells that will be infused.

Chemotherapy with bortezomib to increase NK cell function.

Infusion of the NK cells. In this dose-escalating study, successive groups of patients entering the study receive increasingly higher numbers of cells to determine the highest safe dose level. Up to ten dose levels may be studied.

Interleukin-2 drug therapy to maintain NK cell activity.

Evaluations during therapy including:

* Clinical assessment, history and review of medications
* Blood draws for routine and research tests.
* Pharmacokinetics study after the NK infusion to see how the body handles the cells. For this test, the number of NK cells in the blood are measured over time.

- Gemcitabine and carboplatin are chemotherapy drugs used to treat several types of cancer, including cancer of the pancreas, bladder, ovaries, and lung. Lenalidomide, a drug that prevents the growth of new blood vessels in tumors, has been approved for treatment of certain blood cancers, but it has not yet been approved for use in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin. Researchers are interested in determining the safest and most effective dose of this combined form of chemotherapy for solid tumors, particularly for urothelial cancer (tumors of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis).

Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and carboplatin as a treatment for solid tumor cancers.
* To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and carboplatin as a treatment for urothelial (bladder) cancer.

Eligibility:

* Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatments.
* Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with urothelial cancer that has not responded to standard treatments.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests, and tumor imaging studies.
* Participants with urothelial cancer will receive lenalidomide alone for the first 14 days of a 21-day cycle before starting the first full treatment cycle.
* All participants will receive gemcitabine on days 1 and 8, and carboplatin on day 1 only, of every 21-day treatment cycle. Lenalidomide will be taken daily at home for the first 14 days of each cycle. Participants will be asked to take aspirin or other medications to prevent the possibility of blood clots.
* Participants may receive up to six cycles of treatment with this combination. If after six cycles the cancer has not grown or has shrunk, participants may continue to take lenalidomide alone for an additional 6 months (total of 12 months of therapy) or until the cancer recurs.
* Participants will be monitored with blood samples, physical examinations, and tumor imaging studies through the cycles of treatment.

What we do know is that symptoms are common and can become severe and lasting. The main purpose of this study is two-fold:

1. To better understand the symptom experience of persons with lung cancer prior to surgery and for up to six weeks after returning home from the hospital.
2. To examine the role of a light physical activity program in persons who are undergoing surgery for lung cancer for the treatment of a specific symptom.

The goals of this study include:

* Collecting information about the participant's current and prior health history, symptoms, and health-related quality of life.
* Assessing our ability to recruit participants to the study.
* Assessing participant's level of participation.
* Evaluating the participant's satisfaction with the program.

We expect that patients after undergoing surgery for lung cancer during the recovery process will experience multiple symptoms. We also expect to find that a light intensity physical activity program will be feasible, acceptable, and show a positive impact on symptoms such as cancer-related fatigue and confidence for cancer-related fatigue self-management.

This study has two stages. In the erlotinib group, the combination treatment will be given to participants with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-treatment-naive, advanced (nonresectable) NSCLC in a safety-evaluation stage and to participants with previously untreated EGFR mutation-positive, advanced NSCLC in an expansion stage (Stage 2). In the alectinib group, for both the safety-evaluation and expansion stages (Stages 1 and 2), the combination will be given to participants who are treatment-naive with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced NSCLC.

In Stage 1, erlotinib will be given at a starting dose of 150 milligrams (mg) by mouth (PO) once daily (QD) and the starting dose of alectinib will be 600 mg twice daily (BID), for 28 consecutive days during Cycle 1 and on Days 1 through 21 of each cycle thereafter. The starting dose of atezolizumab will be 1200 mg, administered every 3 weeks (q3W) starting on Day 8 of Cycle 1. If the starting regimen for a combination treatment is not tolerated, alternative doses and/or schedules of erlotinib and atezolizumab or alectinib and atezolizumab may be tested to determine potential recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for that combination treatment. In Stage 2, a potential RP2D and schedule for each combination treatment will be investigated in an expansion cohort.

For both stages, continuation of treatment beyond Cycle 1 will be at the discretion of the treating investigator. Study treatment will be discontinued in participants who experience disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, are not compliant with the study protocol, or, in their opinion or in the opinion of the investigator, are not benefiting from study treatment.

NCT00023673,Radiation Therapy Combined With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00023673,,COMPLETED,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving them with specialized radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the effectiveness of radiation therapy combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients who have stage III non-small cell lung cancer.",YES,Lung Cancer,DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel|RADIATION: three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy,"Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Three-dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3DRT), in Terms of Gy Per Fraction, Combined With Concurrent Chemotherapy, Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) = Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities (excluding nausea, vomiting, and alopecia) and Grade 4 hematologic toxicities. The DLT rate for this study was set at 40% based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study 94-10. No acute (within 90 days from start of 3DRT) DLT's in the first 5 patients (0/5) or the combination of one acute DLT in the first 5 patients (1/5) and none in the next 2 patients (0/2) was required to deem a given dose level to be acceptable. If at any time a Grade 5 toxicity (death) occurred, accrual would be suspended and the event reviewed by a study chair. At any given dose level, this design gives at least 90% confidence that the true acute DLT rate is less than 40% and the probability of not escalating when the true toxicity rate is 40% or higher is at least 83%.

Using a one-group chi-square test with alpha = 0.10, a sample size of 50 patients provides at least 87% power to detect a 25% or greater relative increase in the 12-month survival rate, or equivalently, an absolute increase of at least 15.6 percentage points (62.3 versus 77.9).

The clinical trial is designed to evaluate the possible enhanced antitumor activity of CV301 with Anti-PD1-Therapy. The rationale for combining CV301 with Anti-PD1-Therapy is based on the hypothesis that CV301 can induce specific immune response in the tumor, and that in combination, Anti-PD1-Therapy may augment the T cell-mediated immune response generated by CV301 by blocking the inhibitory signal of the PD-1.

The trial will include a Phase 1 portion and a Phase 1b portion with 2 cohorts. The Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation part to assess the safety and tolerability of CV301 alone, prior to moving into the combination with Anti-PD1-Therapy (the Phase 1b component).

Aldesleukin may help the laboratory-treated white blood cells stay in the body longer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as zoledronic acid, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cellular adoptive immunotherapy together with interleukin-2 and zoledronic acid may kill more tumor cells.

NCT00926640,A Phase I Study of Belinostat in Combination With Cisplatin and Etoposide in Adults With Small Cell Lung Carcinoma and Other Advanced Cancers,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00926640,,COMPLETED,"BACKGROUND:

* The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a novel class of anticancer agent. These agents lead to the increased acetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins, which leads to rapid cell death in many tumor models. It is thought that the cell death observed with this class of agents may be mediated, in part, through the selective acetylation of histone proteins resulting in increased expression of specific genes.
* For solid tumors in general, cell death in preclinical models has not translated to activity in patients. For this reason, studies increasingly have combined chemotherapy with HDAC inhibitors to achieve additive and potentially synergistic effects on cancer cells.
* This protocol will study a continuous infusion of the HDAC inhibitor belinostat in combination with cisplatin and etoposide for patients with advanced cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

* To determine a safe and tolerable phase 2 dose for the combination of belinostat with cisplatin and etoposide.
* Evaluate molecular markers of HDAC inhibition.

ELIGIBILITY:

* The protocol will be open to all patients with recurrent or advanced cancer (small-cell lung cancer and other advanced cancers) for whom standard therapy offers no curative potential.
* Age greater than or equal to 18 years
* ECOG Performance Status 0-2

DESIGN:

* The study will begin with belinostat 400 mg/m (2)/24h administered by continuous IV infusion on days 1 and 2, cisplatin at 80 mg/m (2) IV on day 2, and etoposide at 100 mg/m (2) IV daily times 3 on days 2 - 4. Dose escalation of belinostat will follow according to traditional 3 patient cohorts.

* Advanced cases of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) usually are not successfully treated with standard therapies. Even treatments that attempt to specifically target NSCLC cells have not proved effective.
* Researchers are interested in determining whether a combination of the chemotherapy drugs SS1 (dsFv) PE38, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab may be effective in shrinking the size of NSCLC tumors. Three of the drugs (paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab) are commercially available, while the other is a drug that is currently being tested to determine its usefulness in cancer treatment. This study will help to determine if the combination of all four drugs is more effective and as safe, safer, or less safe than other drug combinations given to treat NSCLC.

Objectives:

- To determine a safe and tolerable dose for the combination of SS1 (dsFv) PE38 with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with advanced mesothelin-expressing lung adenocarcinoma.

Eligibility:

* Age \> 18 years of age
* Newly diagnosed advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma
* No prior chemotherapy for lung cancer
* Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma that has not responded to standard treatments.

Design:

* The study will last for two 21-day cycles of treatment for the four-drug combination, with additional treatment cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.
* Two to three weeks prior to the study, participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical exam, bone marrow biopsy (we do not do bone marrow biopsies) (if one has not been performed in the last 6 months), computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound scan, tumor measurements, and other tests as required by the researchers. Participants will provide blood and urine samples at this time as well.
* During the study, participants will receive SS1 (dsFv) PE38, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab for a maximum of two cycles. On Day 15 of the first cycle, participants will provide a blood sample to be tested to see if SS1 (dsFv) PE38 is being effective. If the tests show that SS1 (dsFv) PE38 is not effective, participants will not receive another dose of it, but will continue to receive paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab for the second cycle.

It will establish the proper vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The vaccine contains killed lung cancer cells containing a mouse gene that causes the production of a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the immune response to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the patient's own cancer cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the tumor to remain stable or shrink.

Patients 18 years of age or older with non-small cell lung cancer that has recurred or no longer responds to standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest x-rays, and lung function testing. CT, MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans of the chest may be obtained if needed.

Participants will receive four vaccinations a month apart from each other. The vaccines will be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be safe in Phase I. Weekly blood samples will be drawn during the 4 months of vaccine treatment. In addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 2 months for the first year after vaccination and then every 3 months for the next 2 years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects:

* Medical history and physical examination
* Blood tests
* X-rays and various scans (nuclear medicine/CT/MRI)
* FACT-L Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the patient's general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment, before each vaccination, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It includes questions on the severity of lung cancer symptoms and the ability to perform normal activities of daily life.

In addition to the above procedures, 3 skin punch biopsies will be done at the vaccination site to look for a local immune response. For this procedure, an area of skin is numbed with an anesthetic and a 4 mm (about 1/4-inch) circular area is removed, using a sharp cookie cutter-type instrument. Also, one blood sample per year will be collected for the next 15 years to monitor the safety of the gene transfer.

At the same time, the investigators will also be testing the safety of LDE225 in combination with etoposide and cisplatin.

The investigators also want to learn more about how to manage side effects the patient may develop during chemotherapy. Cancer patients may develop side effects during treatment, such as nausea, pain, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, or shortness of breath. These symptoms may be due to the cancer itself, or due to treatments. Doctors and nurses often ask patients about their symptoms, because an important part of cancer treatment is to make patients feel as well as possible. If patients do not feel well, the investigators may need to change the way they are treating the patients or prescribe therapies that will decrease their symptoms.

The best way to find out how the patient is feeling is to ask them directly. The investigators are interested in developing new ways to ask patients about how they are feeling, using the Internet. A special new website called STAR (""Symptom Tracking and Reporting for Patients"") has been developed to help patients record this information, so that their doctors and nurses can review it during clinic appointments. This study is designed to help us see if STAR is a helpful way for us to keep track of information about patients' symptoms and quality of life.

The primary objective of this phase I, is to determine the safety and tolerability of oral Gefitinib in combination with escalating doses of Tremelimumab and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives include evaluation of, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, antitumor activity of Gefitinib and Tremelimumab combination. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate biomarkers that may correlate with activity or prospectively identify patients likely to respond to Tremelimumab and Gefitinib.

The biological rationale for such a study is that even though the disease is progressing it is likely that EGFR sensitive clones, although diminished under the pressure from the EGFR TKI, are still present. Therefore, withdrawing the inhibitory pressure of the EGFR TKI can potentially allow regrowth of the EGFR sensitive cells. On the other hand, the proliferation of EGFR resistant clones needs to be suppressed by another therapeutic approach. Until today no association of chemotherapy and TKI EGFR has demonstrated clinical benefit. Moreover, patients may have received chemotherapy and the likelihood of chemosensitivity is very low.

There are two ways of achieving this effect. The first way to specifically target the molecular pathways that promote new blood vessel formation in cancer. An example of such an agent is sorafenib, which is an oral agent and which is already in use worldwide for the treatment of kidney and liver cancers. The second way is to target the cells lining the blood vessels by using low dose of chemotherapy agents administered at frequent intervals. This strategy is called metronomic chemotherapy. It is possible that combining agents like sorafenib and metronomic chemotherapy may further enhance anti-cancer effects. This study aims to determine the optimal way of combining oral vinorelbine in metronomic doses and sorafenib. Oral vinorelbine is a chemotherapy agent that is already approved for use in cancer treatment such as lung cancer. By combining both oral anti-cancer agents to optimize their anti-angiogenic effects in this study, the potential benefit to the patients can be tremendous and far-reaching.

NCT02798536,Mesothelin-Targeted Immunotoxin LMB-100 in People With Malignant Mesothelioma,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02798536,,COMPLETED,"Background:

LMB-100 is a man-made protein. It is attracted to the mesothelin protein. This is found in many tumors, including mesothelioma. But it is found in only a very small number of normal tissues. After binding to mesothelin on tumors, LMB-100 attacks and kills cancer cells. Researchers want to test LMB-100 in people with advanced mesothelioma.

Objective:

To find a safe dose and anti-tumor activity of LMB-100 for people with advanced mesothelioma.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18 and older with:

Advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma that has not responded to platinum-based

therapy

Adequate organ function

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Samples of tumor tissue or tumor fluid. These can be new or from a previous procedure.

Medical history

Physical exam

Blood, urine, and heart tests

Chest x-rays

Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans

Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans

Participants will get LMB-100 on days 1, 3, and 5 of each 21-day cycle. It will be given through an intravenous (IV) catheter, a tube inserted in an arm vein. They will get standard medicines before each infusion to help prevent side effects. Each infusion lasts about 30 minutes. They will be monitored for up to 2 hours after.

During each cycle, participants will repeat the screening tests.

Participants will get the study drug for up to 4 cycles or until their disease worsens or they have intolerable side effects.

About 4-6 weeks after their last infusion, participants will have a follow-up visit. They will repeat the study tests.

Participants will have follow-up scans every 6 weeks until their disease gets worse.

Participants will be called about once a year to see how they are doing.",YES,Mesothelioma,DRUG: LMB-100|DRUG: nab-paclitaxel,"Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of LMB100 + Nab-paclitaxel, Highest administered dose of LMB-100 + nab-paclitaxel at which no more than 1 of 6 participants experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

NCT00923741,Effect of Talactoferrin in Adults With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00923741,,COMPLETED,"Background:

More effective therapies are needed for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has advanced or spread beyond the original site following standard treatment.

Talactoferrin is a genetically engineered form of the human protein lactoferrin, found in body secretions such as breast milk, tears and saliva.

In previous studies, talactoferrin improved life span in patients with NSCLC without causing toxic side effects.

Objectives:

To examine the effects of talactoferrin on the immune system and determine its effectiveness in treating NSCLC.

Eligibility:

Patients with advanced NSCLC who have tissue type HLA-A2 and whose cancer has gotten worse following at least one course of treatment.

Design:

Talactoferrin treatment: Patients take liquid talactoferrin twice a day for 12 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off the drug. Treatment may continue in these 14-week cycles depending on the drug side effects and the response of the tumor.

Evaluations: Patients are evaluated at the clinic with a physical examination, check of vital signs and blood tests every 3 weeks.

CT scans: Patients have CT scans to monitor disease before starting treatment, again at 6 weeks and 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks during the duration of treatment.

Apheresis: Quantities of white blood cells called lymphocytes are collected through a procedure called apheresis in order to measure the immune response to treatment. In this procedure, blood is collected through a needle placed in a vein in the arm (similar to donating blood) and circulated through a cell separator machine. The lymphocytes are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle.",NO,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,DRUG: Talactoferrin|PROCEDURE: Apheresis,"To evaluate the effects of talactoferrin to patients with advanced NSCLC on quantitative and functional changes in CD4, CD8, NK, and Treg populations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the levels of cytokines and chemokines in s...",To evaluate clinical response to talactoferrin.

This fluid is called a malignant pleural effusion. This fluid takes up space in your chest, and prevents your lung from fully filling with air. As a result, you may be experiencing shortness of breath, cough, or chest discomfort. Your doctors have determined that you would feel better if a surgeon or pulmonary specialist removed this fluid immediately. Your doctors are offering to admit you to the hospital, and drain the fluid using a Pleur-XTM catheter.

Once the Pleur-X catheter is in place, your doctors would like to start your chemotherapy.

Your doctors have decided to treat you with chemotherapy. If the chemotherapy works to kill the cancer cells in your body, the cancer will make less fluid, and your doctors will be able to remove the Pleur-XTM catheter sooner.

It is possible that adding a second drug to the chemotherapy, called bevacizumab may make he fluid dry up even faster. It is not known whether adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy for patients with a Pleur-XTM catheter in place is more helpful, or potentially more harmful, than using chemotherapy alone.

In Canada, there has been tremendous success for survivorship programs for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, however lung cancer survivorship programs have not been widely developed. The complexity of the disease, high mortality, short survival times, high cost of surveillance, and patient habits have traditionally been barriers against the success of lung cancer survivorship programs. The investigator proposes a feasibility study to pilot a novel intervention titled Breathe Anew, which will aim to identify and overcome the barriers to the design and implementation of a lung cancer survivorship program. The investigator has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts and lung cancer survivors who will develop the Breathe Anew survivorship intervention. The intervention will be vetted using an integrated knowledge translation approach, which will involve members of the target population, primarily patients who previously underwent lung resection, to modify the intervention and ensure acceptability. After Breathe Anew has been designed, it will be tested in a pilot study of 50 patients to ensure its feasibility and determine its cost.

NCT00001944,Vinorelbine and XR9576 to Treat Cancer,https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001944,,COMPLETED,"Tumor resistance to anti-cancer drugs is a major problem in cancer treatment. Studies have found that a protein (P-glycoprotein) on some cancer cells pumps chemotherapy drugs out of the cells, reducing treatment effectiveness. In laboratory tests, an experimental drug called XR9576, has blocked pumping by this protein. It is being used in this study to try to increase the amount of the anti-cancer drug vinorelbine, in cancer cells. Vinorelbine has been shown in several clinical trials to be effective against some advanced cancers, including breast, lung and ovarian, and is one of the drugs pumped out of tumor cells by P-glycoprotein.

Patients with cancer 18 years and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with tests that may include blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, CT scans, X-rays, and nuclear medicine studies. A tumor biopsy may be done for diagnostic or research purposes.

Study participants will undergo tumor imaging with the radioactive drug Tc-99m Sestamibi. This drug accumulates in tumor cells and is eliminated from them in much the same way that some cancer drugs are eliminated from cells. The drug is injected into a vein and a series of pictures are taken with a gamma camera. After this baseline scan, patients will receive a dose of XR9576 and undergo a second scan 24 hours later. The scan will show whether XR9576 affects the accumulation and elimination of Sestamibi in tumor cells. This procedure may provide a way to monitor cancers for evidence of chemotherapy resistance and show if XR9576 can improve the effectiveness of therapy.

At least 10 days after the baseline and XR9576 scans, patients will begin the first of 3 or more 21-day cycles of vinorelbine treatment. On days 1 and 8 of each cycle, patients will receive a 30-minute infusion of XR9576 intravenously (through a vein) followed by vinorelbine, infused over a 6- to 10-minute period. (In some patients, XR9576 will be administered before only one of the two vinorelbine dosages.)

Because of the high incidence and mortality of this disease, small improvements in the management of this disease translates into large numbers of patients having improved outcomes after treatment. Radiation therapy is widely used to treat patients with lung cancer. However, the radiation dose to the tumor has been limited by the proximity of normal structures to the tumor, such as the lung, the spinal cord and the esophagus. The normal structures must not be exposed to excessive radiation doses. A new technique, called intensity-modulated radiotherapy delivers radiation to tumors such that the normal structures around the tumor are exposed to less radiation than previously achievable. This technique is already used to treat head and neck cancers. This study will use this technique to deliver more intensified radiation to the lung tumor after the patient receives two cycles of chemotherapy. A new imaging technique, called positron emission tomography (PET), has been found to be more sensitive and specific at detecting the extent of the tumor in the lung than the older imaging technique of computed tomography (CT). This study will use both the PET and CT to target the radiation beams. Following treatment, the patients will be followed up to assess the side effects of normal tissues and response of the tumor to the treatment.",NO,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",PROCEDURE: Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy,safety and adverse effects,efficacy and survival,,Alberta Health services,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,5,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,LU-11-0035,2003-09,,2007-08,2005-08-11,,2010-02-09,"Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 1V2, Canada",
